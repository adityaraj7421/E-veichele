      " An e-rickshaw, or electric rickshaw, is a three-wheeled, battery-powered vehicle designed for eco-friendly urban transportation. Unlike traditional rickshaws powered by fuel, e-rickshaws run on rechargeable batteries, significantly reducing air and noise pollution. These vehicles are particularly popular for short-distance commutes, like in city centers, tourist spots, and residential areas, providing an economical and sustainable option for both drivers and passengers.E-rickshaws feature a sturdy frame, comfortable seating for 2-4 passengers, and a compact design that allows them to navigate narrow streets easily. With zero emissions and low maintenance costs, e-rickshaws are an excellent choice for sustainable, cost-effective, and efficient transport.",
